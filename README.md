# Snake_Game_Assembly  
The project is a simple Snake game developed using Assembly Language for 8086 microprocessor. The idea is to create a game where the player controls the snakeâ€™s movement using keyboard arrow keys, aiming to avoid collisions with the screen borders or the snake itself. The game leverages low-level programming concepts like managing screen positions using video memory and implementing delays to ensure smooth gameplay.
